# Quantower-themes
Hey there, intrepid trader! üåü Tired of staring at the same ol' screen all day? Want to add a little spice to your trading life? You've come to the right place! We've got three amazing color themes that‚Äôll transform your Quantower platform into a visual masterpiece. Whether you're into the dark, mysterious vibes of **Dracula**, the gothic intensity of **Dracula Pro Van Helsing**, or the gentle, eye-soothing contrast of **Solarized**, we've got you covered.

Let's dive into how you can install these themes and give your trading experience a fresh coat of paint!

## üìÇ Theme Installation Guide

### 1. Choose Your Theme
   
Decide which theme best suits your trading persona and copy the css content from that file:

**Dracula:** Classic purplish dark color theme, perfect for late-night market hunts.

**Dracula Pro Van Helsing:** Dive into the gothic depths with the Dracula Pro Van Helsing palette. Beware: It‚Äôs very dark and very stylish.

**Solarized:** Go easy on the eyes with the Solarized dark palette. It‚Äôs like trading in a serene zen garden where everything is washed out a bit.

### 2. Create Theme Directories

Now let‚Äôs get into the nuts and bolts. Here‚Äôs the roadmap:

1. Navigate to your Quantower root directory. This is where all the Quantower magic happens. Think of it as the Hogwarts of trading.

2. Within your Quantower root, go to the `Settings\Themes` directory. If `Themes` doesn‚Äôt exist yet, no worries‚Äîjust create it!

3. Inside the `Settings\Themes` create a new directory with the name of your chosen theme: `Dracula`, `DraculaPro`, `Solarized` - pick the one that speaks to your soul ‚Äî or your eyes.

4. Inside your newly created theme folder (e.g., `Dracula`), create another directory named `css`. Yes, it's a directory within directory ‚Äî like Russian nesting dolls, but more technical.

### 3. Create `colors.css`

1. In the `css` directory, create a file named `colors.css`.

2. Copy the CSS content from the corresponding file in this repo and paste it into your `<quantower>\Settings\Themes\Dracula\css\colors.css` file. (or `\Solarized\css\colors.css` or `\DraculaPro\css\colors.css`)
  
7. Start Quantower, go to the first settings page and pick your new theme - should be visible at the top of settings pane. Voil√†! You've just given your Quantower a shiny new coat of paint.

## üõ† Troubleshooting
If you run into any issues, don‚Äôt panic! Just make sure:

- You are in the correct Quantower directory structure
- The colors.css file has the right name and is in the right place.
- You‚Äôre using the correct CSS content for your theme.

Still stuck? Try turning Quantower off and on again. Just kidding ‚Äî actually, that might work. If not, you might want to consult the all-knowing internet.
